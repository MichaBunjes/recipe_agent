Fry for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the leeks are soft. Add the cumin, lemon, and vegetable stock and boil rapidly for 4–5 minutes, until most of the stock has evaporated. Fold in the spinach and cook for 1 minute, until wilted, then decrease the heat to medium.",

        "Mix the za’atar with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil and brush over the eggs. Serve at once, straight from the pan."
