This simple way of slow-roasting celeriac whole, with nothing but oil and salt, is a method we have explored in the past, serving it simply with a squeeze of lemon or a spoonful of crème fraîche. You can definitely do that with this celeriac. Here, though, this process, in which the starches are converted into sugars (see more on p. 29) that seep out in a wonderful celeriac-flavoured caramel, is harnessed to make three very different celeriac-centred dishes. If you don’t get a lot of that aforementioned caramel after roasting, just brush the celeriac with oil and a little maple syrup or honey once it’s been cut. The celeriac is best cooked on the day, but you can roast it the day before if you want to get ahead.

        "Preheat the oven to 200°C fan. Lightly grease a large 28cm non-stick sauté pan, for which you have a lid, or a similar-sized round ovenproof dish, and transfer it to the oven to heat for 5 minutes.",
        "In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients and ¼ teaspoon salt until thoroughly coated (this is easiest with gloved hands). Remove the pan from the oven, tip in the potato mixture and spread out evenly. Bake for 25 minutes, uncovered, rotating the pan halfway through cooking until golden-brown and crisp on top.",
        "Make eight wells with the back of a spoon. Crack an egg into each hole, then cover the pan with the lid and return it to the oven for 8–10 minutes, or until the whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny. Use a small spoon to carefully peel away the white film that has formed over the eggs, if you like, to reveal the yolks beneath. Season them with a little salt.",
        "Mix all the ingredients for the salsa together in a small bowl, drizzle over the eggs and serve straight from the pan, with the lime wedges squeezed on top. Enough versions were made to sink a large ship in our mission to create the best meatless ragù (Ixta nearly lost her will to live, but that has happened once or twice before). There’s no denying the list of ingredients is long, but these are all there to give the ragù its fantastic umaminess. The method, however, could not be simpler. If you have a food processor, the first six ingredients can all be pulsed in it until finely chopped, saving you lots of time and effort. The ragù will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for a month, ready to be spooned over anything from pasta to polenta (try it with the fresh corn polenta on p. 140, minus the peppers and egg), or used as the base for lasagne or shepherd’s pie. For the latter two, cook the ragù a bit less, as it will carry on cooking in the oven. Thank you to Emily Moore and Josh Renaut, who tirelessly took home every single version of this ragù to give their thoughtful feedback as recent converts to veganism. 3 carrots, peeled and chopped into large chunks (250g) 2 onions, peeled and chopped into large chunks (300g) 300g oyster mushrooms, roughly chopped 60g dried porcini, roughly blitzed 4 garlic cloves, crushed 3–4 plum tomatoes, chopped into large chunks (350g) 120ml olive oil 70g white miso paste 40g rose harissa (adjust according to the brand you are using; see p. 20) 4 tbsp tomato paste 90ml soy sauce 2 tsp cumin seeds, crushed 180g dried brown or green lentils 100g pearl barley 1 litre vegetable or chicken stock 160g coconut cream 100ml red wine salt and black pepper",
        "Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.",
        "Working in batches, put the first six ingredients into a food processor and pulse until everything is very finely chopped (or very finely chop everything by hand if you don’t have a food processor).",
        "Put the chopped vegetables into a large, 36cm x 28cm non-stick high-sided baking tray with the oil, miso, harissa, tomato paste, soy sauce and cumin seeds and mix very well. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through, until browned around the edges and bubbling.",
        "Reduce the heat to 180°C fan.",
        "Add all the remaining ingredients to the tray, along with 150ml of water, ⅓ teaspoon of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper. Stir very well, scraping the crispy sides and bottom with a spatula. Cover tightly with foil and bake for another 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for a final 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes for the sauce to be absorbed a little before serving."

It’s not so much what you do to an ingredient (‘process’) or the ingredient itself (‘produce’), but the combination of various ingredients with what we have identified to be the four most important ‘pairings’: sweetness, fat, acidity and chilli heat. These pairings play out, in big and small ways, in so many of the things we all love to eat. Think of your favourite sandwich. Sandwiches are, arguably, the ultimate elevation of the most everyday of ingredients – bread – by virtue of what it’s paired with. Spread the bread with butter and you’ve already hit first base: fat. Ask Ixta what her dream sandwich is and she’ll say porchetta and apricot mustard. The combination is not, for obvious reasons, one found in this book but it does demonstrate the principle. The porchetta brings the fat to the equation and then the apricot mustard – which neatly ticks all the remaining sweet, chilli heat and acidity boxes – makes this an easy home run. Yotam’s sandwich would be a mix of olive-oil-roasted vegetables and chillies, piled over toasted sourdough with some pecorino shavings or crumbled feta on top. Again: tick, tick, tick, tick. Not all sandwiches need to hit every note to make perfect sense – think of peanut butter and jam, or smashed avocado and chilli, prawn mayonnaise or a BLT. You’ll see one or two or all of these pairings playing out. Let’s look at sweetness, fat, acidity and chilli heat one at a time. SWEETNESS When we try to understand how sweetness works in a savoury setting, as opposed to the more apparent puddingy context it is useful to pull back to the title of this book for a minute. FLAVOUR – what is it, actually? How does it relate to taste? What are the forces that shape this complex sensory experience of ours? Taste is what we detect with the taste buds in our mouth. We have five tastes. Sweetness is one of them. The others are sour, bitter, salt and savoury (umami). Flavour, on the other hand, is picked up by the olfactory cells inside our noses. These cells respond to airborne compounds, many of which are released as we chew our food. Flavour is taste plus aroma. The sweet taste of a peach will be happily detected by our little taste buds when we take our first bite. Flavour, though, can’t be realised without the additional smell, the aroma, the fragrance of that perfectly ripe fruit. Appreciating the complexity of flavour is essential to shedding light on how sweetness plays its role in a savoury dish. Just as flavour is made up of taste and aroma, the different tastes also never work in isolation. In a savoury context, something is not simply ‘sweet’, nor is it simply ‘sour’ or ‘bitter’ or ‘salty’. Rather, it is a combination of one or two or all of these things. Take some of our favourite sweet ingredients in the recipes here. White miso or mirin, for example, pink grapefruit, tomatoes, oranges, maple syrup. The experience of eating these is not that they form a neat queue along the taste buds which say ‘sweetness’. Rather, they charge an assault on all the senses! TASTES Not only are all ingredients a combination of more than one ‘thing’ – sweet and salty, sweet and savoury – these tastes all need and rely on each other in order to shine. What would bitter cocoa powder be, after all, without its very opposite, sweet sugar? Satisfaction is about the combination, the layering, the contrast of tastes. With sweetness this is particularly pertinent because, without the complexity, you’re running the risk of turning your dish into a dessert. Whatever the pairing – whether it’s about layering together two of the same tastes or contrasting one against another – it’s always about the balance. Let’s look at some of our recipes to see this playing out. First, layering. This is where one sweet ingredient pairs with one or two others. The effect is to bring complexity – another dimension – to a straightforwardly sweet taste. This is where wedges of sweet pumpkin, for example, are roasted together with a sweet spice like cinnamon, as we do in our Or where a tablespoon or two of rich maple syrup and sweet-savoury white miso are added to a tray of butternut squash, as we do with before the whole thing gets roasted. PARENTS All these combinations of sweetness upon sweetness need to be kept in check, though. It’s one thing layering so as to introduce depth of flavour, but sweetness can tip into cloying. Anyone who has tried the dish sometimes served at a Thanksgiving meal, which combines sweet potato, sweet cinnamon, marshmallows and maple syrup, will know what we mean. Roasting a sweet potato alone shows how much long and slow cooking sweetens this starchy vegetable. This is thanks to the action of an enzyme that attacks the starch and breaks it down to maltose, a sugar made up of two glucose molecules that’s about a third as sweet as table sugar. And that’s all before the maple syrup and marshmallows have been added to the equation. As well as giving us a little lesson in starch conversion, this particular dish is also basically a controlled experiment in the need for a salty slice of ham or rasher of bacon at the Thanksgiving table. In the absence of either in FLAVOUR, other ingredients do as well. Roasting our squash and carrots with a woody spice like caraway or a hard herb like sage, for example, is something we do in our Doing this keeps the vegetable’s sweetness in check (rather than drawing it out, as a sweet spice like cinnamon would). Sprigs of thyme do this for the on Spreading the base of the galette with a layer of mascarpone also works. At other times it’s a squeeze of lime or lemon juice or the use of a sharp vinegar that does the work to balance the sweetness. It can, on the other hand, be the addition of something acidic or hot which is the thing that keeps (or even heightens) the desired sweetness in an ingredient in the first place. Think of a slice of pineapple. Take a bite and the dominant taste is sweet. Sprinkle it with a little salt and chilli and try it again. The addition of salt and chilli, counter-intuitively, serves to actually amplify the fruit’s sweetness. We often talk about the ‘experience’ of tasting sweetness rather than the taste of sweetness being an absolute. This is because everyone’s experience of sweetness is different. Furthermore, taste buds change and develop over time. What we experience as bitter or sweet changes as we grow up. A whole generation of kids preferring ‘sweet’ carrots to ‘bitter’ Brussels sprouts is not just a great big conspiracy against their parents. Infants have around 30,000 taste buds, only about a third of which survive into adulthood. Their sensitivity towards extremes of bitter or sweet really is heightened. Separate from what an ingredient is paired with, there can, as well, be a huge range of sweetness within an ingredient itself. Compare an aged balsamic vinegar with a younger version, for example, and you’ll be reaching for words far beyond simple ‘sweetness’. Ditto premium-grade maple syrup or Shaoxing rice wine. Think about those chunks of pumpkin and squash as another example, the many varieties of which could fill a whole book. Pumpkin is just one variety of squash. There are, in addition, all the Asian and African varieties: the cucumbers and gherkins, for example, the melons, watermelons and gourds. Then there are the North and South American varieties. These are divided into winter squashes (firm and sweet) and summer squashes (soft and only mildly sweet). A deep dive to end on, but it’s all to say that discussions about whether we have four or five tastes slightly miss the point: we have about thirty-five different kinds of ‘sweetness’ for squash, for starters! And we haven’t even got to pudding! Forget about what to call things, perhaps. Focus instead on the taste, the aroma – the combination of which makes the flavour – of our sweetness-showcasing recipes instead. FAT Twice already we’ve drawn attention to the unscientific nature of our system for understanding flavour through what an ingredient is paired with. It’s not that we’re not interested in the science per se; it’s just not the real reason we reach for things in the kitchen. When it comes to analysing our cooking experiences – how they work and what happens if they don’t – the option to get technical is absolutely there. Olive oil and how it works so well as a cooking medium is a good place to start. Olive oil belongs to a large chemical family called lipids, and lipids are chemically unlike water. One of their differences is that they have a much higher boiling point. This allows for a much higher cooking temperature, which, in turn, gives the surface of whatever is being cooked time to dry out and for the texture to become really crispy. With the water removed, the flavour then becomes more concentrated and intense. As we saw when looking at browning in the first chapter vegetables boiled in water are only ever going to taste like hot versions of themselves. Switch the water for oil, 30), though – oil being a ‘liquid fat’ – and the conditions for the production of intense browning-reaction flavours (the Maillard reaction) are set up. Fat is what makes our crispy when fried. It’s what makes our slices of aubergine lightly browned when roasted for the All the wonderful, intense, interesting flavour and texture is, in short, thanks to the use – or pairing – of fat with the ingredient being cooked from the outset. At the other end of the proceedings, the science can also tell us why fat is such a great way to finish off or complete a dish (rather than to cook with at the outset). Take a simple salad – tomato and basil, for example – and it’s one thing. It’s refreshing and sweet and lovely. That’s three things, we know, but you get the picture. Add some slices of mozzarella, though, or some chunks of tangy feta, and it becomes something entirely different. It’s no longer just the picture; it’s the entire summer holiday. The tangy taste of a sea-salt holiday, to be specific. Add another layer of fat in the form of the requisite olive oil and the dish is complete. The reason the flavour of a good cheese seems to really fill the mouth is due to the enzymes from the milk and the rennet and the microbes. These break down the concentrated protein and fat in the cheese into a wide range of flavour compounds. The more diverse the cast of ripening enzymes, the more complex the resulting collection and the richer the flavour will be. The reason barrel-aged feta has a richer and more complex flavour than standard feta is because the enzymes have had longer to ripen (they need six months to be called ‘aged’, rather than the requisite two) and are, thanks to the beech barrels in which their ageing takes place, more diverse. What the science doesn’t tell us, though, is the instinctive reason we – both in the Ottolenghi test kitchen and in our homes – find ourselves so often reaching for a bottle of olive oil when we are starting or finishing a meal. We reach for it whether we’re chopping an onion at the outset or finishing off a dish before serving. We do this for the unashamedly unscientific reason that we just love it. We love the grassy, peppery taste of the oil. We love the green and shiny look of it. To us, a bottle of good-quality olive oil is the Mediterranean sun made liquid. So, with a little nod to the science and a slightly bigger wink to our appetites, we can have a quick look at the other fats in our recipes and what they are bringing to the dishes they’re in. If olive oil is in the first category of fats – liquid fats – then sunflower oil and butter, once melted and clarified, are part of the same group. You have to match the fat you choose with the dish you are cooking. Butter and olive oil are well suited to the rich Italian polenta, for example but when frying on the other hand , you want all of the benefits that cooking in oil can bring (a crispy outside, in the case of the fritters) without what’s being cooked taking on any of the flavour from the oil. Here, it’s oils such as sunflower (or groundnut or another mild-flavoured variety) that work best. As well as these ‘liquid fats’, we have used all sorts of dairy products in our recipes, all with a very high fat content. Cheddar cheese has 33 grams of fat per 100 grams, for example, closely followed by Gruyère, Parmesan, feta and then mozzarella at 17 grams of fat per 100 grams. We hope that putting a figure on the fat does not make anyone baulk. Fat is flavour and fat is, in our line of work, good. When reaching for something which is ‘fat free’ or ‘low in fat’, just remember that if something has come out then it needs to be replaced by something else going in. In the case of a lot of low-fat yoghurts, for example, this something is often going to be sugar. Give us a spoonful of full-fat, Greek-style plain yoghurt any day of the week. Many is the Otttolenghi recipe, over the years, which has come with the recommendation to serve ‘with a spoonful of yoghurt alongside’. In the case of our up the spoonful to a ladleful so that the yoghurt can form the basis of a rich, creamy dressing. Up the ladleful to a whole pot, no less, if the dressing is to become an entire sauce, served warm with the pasta Here, the yoghurt, with its natural acidity, has the ability to make a pasta sauce which is rich and creamy without any of the ‘cloying’ or ‘unctuousness’ of a cream-based sauce. Our last category of fats, in these recipes, is vegetable fats such as coconut and avocado. Here, the contribution they bring is to do with both flavour and texture. Cooking the dal for our in coconut milk (with at least 70% coconut extract) again, brings a richness, smoothness and also sweetness that water alone or a vegetable stock could not have done. An avocado is grassy and nutty and rich and buttery to taste, yes, but it also brings an incredible fatty smoothness, like butter, to all that it is paired with. Set it against any or all of the accompaniments the pickled onions, the spicy salsa roja or chilli oil – and the science of pairing fat with sweetness, chilli heat and acidity speaks for itself. ACIDITY Acidity. On the one hand it’s really simple. It’s a squeeze of lemon, a wedge of lime; it’s the vinegar in pickles, the tang of feta. Squeeze that certainty, though, and there’s a fair bit of give. Is tanginess quite the same thing as acidity, for example? And while the juice of a lemon is acidic, isn’t the zest more floral or citrusy? And might bitter be a better word for describing the fruit’s pith? Or what about astringent? Or sharp? Or sour? Or tart? We love acidity. We love acidity so much that few of our recipes don’t have a pronounced acidic element to them. If Yotam brings lemons to the test kitchen party, then Ixta walks in with jars full of vinegary quick-pickles under both arms. Noor Murad, our test kitchen colleague, is also there, blitzing up her favourite dried black Omani limes to flavour for example, or piercing them to add to some Tomatoes are at the party too, with their sweet and earthy acidity, bopping along with tamarind pulp, with all the sweet-savoury tartness and complexity it brings to proceedings. Many of the dishes being served at this party would have Greek-style yoghurt added to them, and a party is not an Ottolenghi party, as we all know, without sumac and pomegranate molasses. Acid house party, Ottolenghi-style! So, with our party players assembled, everyone can take a seat and listen to the speeches. First, then: what actually is acidity? Once we’ve established what it is then we can look at what it does. Then we can get back to the party. Scientifically defined, acids are substances which dissolve in water to release hydrogen ions (i.e. charged atoms). They tend to remove oxygen from other substances and combine it with the hydrogen to form water. If oxygen generally causes food to spoil, then acids act as a preservative. This little controlled experiment will be understood by anyone who’s ever made a pot of jam or a jar of ferments or pickles. Any bit of the fruit or vegetable exposed to the air – the top layer of the jam, for example – will develop a layer of mould. Everything below the surface – unexposed to oxygen and preserved by the acetic acid in the vinegar, which inhibits the growth of many microbes – will, meanwhile, be absolutely fine. Acids are classed as either strong or weak depending on their pH level. The ‘p’ stands for ‘potential’ and the ‘H’ stands for hydrogen. The pH level depends, therefore, on the quantity of hydrogen ions something can release. Lemon juice is, speaking generally, about 2.1, wine vinegar is about 2.5. Ketchup is about 3.9 and yoghurt is about 4.0. Milk is about 6.7. Distilled water, which is neutral, sits at pH7. Anything above that is alkaline (and would taste soapy to eat). As ever, our priority is a bit more in-your-face: a bit more ‘What do we get from this and how does it make our food taste great?’ Knowing what acidity is might be all well and good, but what does it do for us in the kitchen? The first thing is to do with colour, the second is to do with texture and the third, of course, it to do with flavour. First: colour. As a preservative, adding an acidic substance to certain vegetables and fruit once they’re peeled prevents them from losing their colour and turning grey. These are the fruit and veg which are prone to oxidation: bananas and apples, for example, artichokes and avocados. Left exposed, they’ll discolour. Rub them with a little bit of lemon juice, though, or submerge them in water which has a squeeze of lemon or a cap full of vinegar in it, and they’ll stay the colour you want them to be. On the other hand, adding acid too soon to certain vegetables will be the precise thing that causes them to lose their colour and turn grey. Very often, in our recipes, the addition of a dressing to a salad is followed by the slightly unrelaxed instruction to ‘serve at once’. The day won’t actually implode if you don’t bolt straight to the table and shout at everyone to start eating NOW, but, still, the vibrancy of your for example, will diminish fairly quickly once the tamarind and lime dressing is spooned over. Make the dressing in advance, by all means, and just keep it separate. Everything else can be ready and waiting. The second great ‘use’ of acidity in the kitchen is to do with texture. The addition of acidic substances to fruit, vegetables and legumes often causes them to cook much more slowly and, also, to toughen up. The reason we always soak a batch of dried chickpeas, for example, in a teaspoon or so of bicarbonate of soda is the very opposite. As bicarbonate of soda is an alkaline substance, it softens up the chickpeas and so speeds up the cooking time. Adding an acidic substance to one’s cooking is totally fine (and often very welcome), but this needs to be done after the onions are softened and sweated down in the pan, for example, or after the beans have been cooked. When you don’t cook them, however, adding something acidic like vinegar to onions will actually start to break down their cell structure rather than harden it. As well as softening onion slices, for example, there is an exchange of flavour the other way – from the onion to the vinegar – which, in turn, can take the harsh edge off the vinegar before it, too, is used in the dish. A mutual mellowing, if you like, as seen in things like the pickled onions served on top of for example The third – and most exciting – point of acidity in the kitchen is to do with flavour, where the main role it plays is that of balance. Think back to those favourite sandwiches we talked about at the beginning of this chapter. None of these fully makes sense or hits the spot without the acidic element. Together, they offer a great example of how versatile acidity is when it comes to balance, counteracting fat (vinegary mustard in Ixta’s porchetta sandwich), sweetness and chilli heat (tangy feta in Yotam’s roasted vegetable and chilli sandwich). This is seen playing out in so many of our recipes: the sumac and lime juice dressing balancing the sweetness of the maple-syrup-roasted carrots in the for example. The dried black lime or lime juice working to balance the richness of the yoghurt in the both the and the The balance works both ways, with the impact of an ingredient’s acidity depending very much on what it is paired with. The more maple syrup added to the tray of carrots roasting, for example, the sweeter the dish is going to taste. The pH level of the lime juice or the sumac is not going to change – they will be as inherently acidic as they would be by themselves – but their impact on the dish as a whole will be reduced. It’s a balancing act, and you can only set the scales to where you want them to be if you know what you’re working with from the outset. It’s not just apples and oranges you can’t compare when it comes to acidity: you can’t really even compare oranges and oranges. Or tomatoes and tomatoes. Or shop-bought tamarind paste with making your own from pulp It’s why tasting your ingredients throughout the cooking process – before, during and just before serving – will always be your best party trick. Every time we publish a book, it feels like the Ottolenghi pantry needs a new shelf. A place to house our latest discoveries and obsessions. For OTTOLENGHI FLAVOUR, this new shelf would be full of chillies. Fresh chillies, dried chillies, chilli flakes, chilli pastes, chilli oils, chilli butters, chilli spice mixes, pickled chillies. If Ixta had her way – thanks, Mexico! – we’d have to find a whole new cupboard. We didn’t find a cupboard, however, so the kitchen got pretty crowded. It got so crowded because the question of ‘What’s needed?’ in a dish was, so often, answered with ‘chilli heat’. If we had had such a cupboard, though, this is what it might have looked like. On one shelf we’d have bowls of fresh chillies. These would be the Fresno or serenade varieties – those often sold in supermarkets as just regular ‘chillies’ – in both red and green. The difference between the two is one of ripeness. As with bell peppers (a member of the chilli family, albeit one without the ‘heat’), green chillies are unripe and not as sweet as those which are ripe and red. The Scoville scale, devised in 1912, assesses how hot a chilli is. It counts the number of times that extracts of chilli dissolved in alcohol can be diluted with sugar water before the capsaicin (the compound which makes them hot) is no longer discernible to the palate. The more heat units it scores, the more fiery the chilli. Sweet chillies (aka peppers, capsicums, bell peppers) score zero. Our ‘regular’ Fresno or serenade chillies score between 2,500 and 8,000. There’s always quite a range because the amount of capsaicin in individual chillies of the same type can vary dramatically. Between types, the range is obviously dramatically wider: jalapeño and cayenne score around 3,000 on the scale, tabasco peppers around 60,000 and habaneros from 100,000 to 300,000. As we said above, chillies are hot because they contain capsaicin. Capsaicin is a flavourless, odourless compound found in the chilli flesh. It’s concentrated particularly in the white ribs inside the chilli where the seeds are (this is why we are asked to deseed a chilli to moderate its heat; as you shave away the seeds, which aren’t actually hot, you also remove the hot white ribs). It’s this, the capsaicin, which binds to pain receptors on the tongue and creates a sensation of burning. This increases as the green chillies ripen but then loses its fire the riper, redder and sweeter they become. If you want the hottest fresh chillies, choose those which are at the turning point from green to red. The flavour of a fresh chilli can be dialled right up through being charred, as we do with the fresh chillies in our Charring, as we saw on concentrates flavour. It imparts complexity, bitterness and sweetness. It’s what gives many a sauce or salsa that extra depth of flavour, the thing that takes them to ‘the next level’. Another way of dialling up the flavour of fresh chillies is to pickle them, as we do for the where they’re spooned over before serving as a wake-up garnish. If charring intensifies flavour, then pickling softens the kick, allowing the chillies to bring their ‘stand-to-attention’ freshness to all the other elements in a dish. So that’s the fresh chilli shelf: chillies as they are, chillies heading off to be charred and fresh chillies, in jars, quickly pickled. The next shelf (or three) would be for the dried chillies. This is where we’d have to be disciplined about how much space we’d allow and how much of the globe we’d be allowed to trot over in our search for chillies (a very tiny fraction, it turns out). There would be jars full of whole dried chillies, ready to be crumbled or steeped into a slowly cooked dish. Smoky chipotle chillies would be there, the dried and mild version of the jalapeño chilli. Round and red cascabels, as well, from central Mexico, which are sweet and nutty and woody. Their name means ‘little bell’, in Spanish, on account of the sound the loose seeds make inside the pod when they’re shaken. Mexican ancho chillies would also be in permanent residence. These are the dried and wide (‘wide’ being what ‘ancho’ means in Spanish) version of the poblano chilli. They’re fruity and sweet and mild in their heat. Then we’d have little jars full of dried chillies that have been blitzed up to become chilli flakes. We might have to colour-code these, just for fun. Bright red bell pepper flakes would be at one end, imparting their vibrant colour into infusions Next to these would be the vibrant, burgundy Aleppo chilli flakes. Like the bell pepper flakes, these . are as much about the colour and sweet aroma they bring to a sauce such as our as they are about their heat, which is mild. Next to these would be the chipotle chilli flakes and then, alongside and far darker in colour, would be the small pots of crimson – almost black – Turkish Urfa chilli flakes. It’s these top shelves that we’d be reaching for to infuse the numbing oil for our for example, or for making chilli butter to smear over our roasted In terms of pairing, in fact, there are very few things not improved by the addition of fat (butter) and heat (chilli) combined. Eggs, chicken, tofu, all vegetables, fish, rice: the on can be sitting for two weeks on the shelf (in the fridge, this time), ready to be used as a rub or melted to become a marinade or final garnish. These top shelves are where we’d also be reaching to make our own chilli pastes were it not for the fact that great-quality chilli pastes are so easy and available to buy. As such, for the purposes of our imaginary chilli-filled cupboard, we’d have shelves given over to all corners of the world. North African rose harissa, bringing its rose- softened kick to our for example along with Korean gochujang fermented chilli paste. Argentinian chimichurri, Tripolitan Jewish chraimeh sauce, Louisianan hot sauce, Mexican Luchito smoked chilli paste, Thai nam prik, African piri piri, Malaysian sambal, Thai sriracha, Middle Eastern zhoug and shatta: there would be few days and few simple suppers not pepped up with a spoonful or two or one of these. Any or all of these chillies and pastes and oils and powders are just so useful to have around because, when thinking about food pairing, they can shoot in virtually any direction, even puddings, as in our Chillies’ great gift, for us, is their ability to somehow marry together a range of flavours – or even to wake up 278). the palate to the existence of these other flavours – and, in so doing, to create a singular harmony. We just need to find a big enough cupboard now to keep everything in. Recipe List"

These are found all over the Middle East, but aren’t quite as popular elsewhere. Try this version, where a tomato and chilli sauce helps cut the fattiness even further. Yoghurt can split when heated, so egg yolks and flour are often used to stabilise it, as they do here. Cooking the sauce slowly will give you the smoothest result, so don’t try to speed up the process by increasing the heat. The quick chilli sauce is excellent to have on hand. Yotam’s",

Add all the remaining ingredients, along with 400ml of hot water and ¾ teaspoon of salt, and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened completely.",
        "Discard the habanero chilli (if using) then transfer to a blender or food processor and blitz to a smooth sauce. Keep warm.",
        "For the chilli oil, lightly toast the chipotle and pepper flakes in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat for 1 minute, until very fragrant, then add the oil and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Heat for about 30 seconds, or until the oil bubbles gently, then remove from the heat and set aside.",
        "For the tamales, blitz the corn in a food processor until you get a wet mash. Put a large sauté pan on a medium- high heat and add the butter. Once melted, add the corn, cream, 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring a few times, until the corn is cooked through and has the consistency of porridge. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 5 minutes, then stir in the masa harina, oil, baking powder and egg until well incorporated – it should have the consistency of playdough.",
        "Cut six rectangles of baking parchment, roughly 25cm x 16cm each. With lightly oiled hands, take about 110g of the dough and shape into a smooth ball. Place in the middle of one of the rectangles of parchment and flatten to make a 15cm x 9cm rectangle. Combine the cheeses in a small bowl with the remaining teaspoon of cumin, then place 20g of the cheese mixture along the centre of the dough. Use your hands to mould the dough over to enclose the cheese on all sides, pinching and smoothing it with your fingers so there are no cracks, to get a 12cm x 6cm rectangle. Fold the parchment on all sides to enclose the tamale, using the paper to help you shape it, then place the parcel seam side down on a tray while you make the remaining five tamales.",
        "Put a large saucepan, for which you have a fitted steaming basket and lid, on a high heat with plenty of water. Once boiling, place the tamales, seam side down, in the steaming basket (you may have to pile some on top of each other, which is fine). Cover with the lid, then reduce the heat to medium and steam for 30 minutes. Leave to cool for a few minutes before unwrapping.",
        "Meanwhile, mix all the ingredients for the salad together with a good pinch of salt.",

For Yotam’s father, who was born in Italy, there was only one way to cook polenta. He would put everything into a pot and then stand by it watchfully and continuously for a good hour, stirring the polenta with great patience, making sure it turned out perfectly and didn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. For a New York Times column in which we turned classical dishes on their heads and cooked them in the oven in one single pan, our test kitchen colleague Noor Murad didn’t only bust Yotam’s childhood myth about the only way to cook polenta, she also did away with the sauce it was normally served with and simply added whole eggs to braise inside the polenta. The result is a rather ‘bumpy’ type of polenta, full of textures and surprises. It’s still marvellously delicious, and means you can read a few pages of your favourite book while the polenta essentially cooks itself. Try to find coarse cornmeal polenta here rather than the quick-cooking kind, as it simply won’t yield the result that you’re looking for. This is a great brunch dish, but will work equally well for lunch or a light dinner with a crunchy green salad. The polenta hardens as it sits, so eat this soon after it comes out of the oven. For brunch or as a light lunch 250g fresh or frozen corn kernels, defrosted if frozen 200g baby spinach, roughly shredded 10g parsley, roughly chopped 10g dill, roughly chopped 20g coriander, roughly chopped, plus an extra tbsp 4 spring onions, finely sliced (60g), plus an extra 2 tbsp 4 garlic cloves, crushed 150g coarse polenta (cornmeal), not the quick-cook variety 50g Parmesan, finely grated 520ml whole milk 450ml vegetable or chicken stock 40g unsalted butter, cut into 2cm cubes 150g feta, roughly crumbled 8 eggs 2 tbsp olive oil ½ tsp chilli flakes salt and black pepper",
        "Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.",
        "Put the corn into a food processor and pulse once or twice, until just roughly chopped, then transfer to a large bowl. Add the spinach, herbs, spring onions, garlic, coarse polenta, Parmesan, 1½ teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper, stirring to combine. Put this mixture into a large, high-sided ovenproof sauté pan, then add the milk, stock and butter, stirring to mix through. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove from the oven and give everything a good whisk before returning it to the oven for another 20 minutes, or until the cornmeal is cooked through and the mixture has thickened. Give the polenta a good whisk – it should be smooth and not completely set – then stir in half the feta. Increase the oven temperature to 200°C fan.",
        "Make eight wells in the polenta, cracking an egg into each and sprinkling lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the remaining feta and return to the oven for 12–14 minutes, or until the whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny.",
        "Meanwhile, combine the extra coriander and spring onion in a bowl with the oil. Spoon this mixture all over the polenta once ready to serve, followed by a sprinkling of the chilli. Serve at once."

Top with four mushroom halves per plate and spoon over a generous amount of the oil and its accompanying aromatics (you won’t need all of it, though – see intro). PRODUCE What you do to a vegetable and what you pair it with are two of the ways in which you amplify its flavour. In some cases, though, there’s so much going on within the ingredient itself that it can pretty much do all the work on its own. Sure, it may still need baking or toasting or frying or roasting to tease out its deliciousness, but this will more often be a case of releasing what’s inherent within the ingredient rather than having to rely on pairing it with something else or somehow transforming its character through process. There are all sorts of ingredients which do this: ingredients which have the capacity to carry a dish through their sheer ‘oomph’ and depth of flavour, or the interesting textural contrast they bring. These are often intensely savoury foods, all rich in the fifth sense, umami. After the first four senses – sweet, sour, salty and bitter – umami roughly translates from the Japanese as something like ‘deliciousness’ or ‘savouriness’. Umami is the result of flavour compounds called glutamates. Unlike monosodium glutamate (which gets a bad rep from being chemically manufactured and liberally sprinkled over many a takeaway, to make it taste generically ‘good’), there are many natural sources of glutamates. Parmesan or anchovies, for example, tomatoes or fermented pickles, soy sauce, seaweed, Marmite, ketchup. And mushrooms, the first of our four ingredients that we celebrate here. MUSHROOMS Play the ‘word association’ game with mushrooms and, chances are, the next word to come along will be something like ‘earthy’ or ‘woody’. There’s a good reason for this. Unlike plants, which grow above the ground, thereby harnessing energy from the sun, mushrooms – which are fungi – do all their growing underground. As mushrooms don’t have the chlorophyll they’d need to get their energy from the sun, they go in search of nourishment elsewhere. Different mushrooms do this in different ways. Some live off plants, others live off plant remains and decay. They feed off whatever they can find. We don’t see this network of fibres pushing through the soil to gain the nutrients they need to grow, and neither is this the part of the mushroom which we pick, cook or eat. They are, nevertheless, the reason they taste so earthy. It’s also the reason why the flavour of one mushroom can differ so wildly and wonderfully from the flavour of another. What they live off affects how they taste. Mushrooms growing under chestnut trees will taste of chestnut and soil. Mushrooms growing under pine trees will taste of pine and soil. Yotam will never lose the memory of foraging for mushrooms with his grandmother when he was growing up in Jerusalem. They found them under the pine trees in the hills surrounding the city. It was early autumn, after the first rains, and felt to Yotam a bit like magic, filling up sacks with mushrooms which appeared from one day (nothing!) to the next (everywhere!). What he didn’t know at the time, of course, was how much of the work was being done out of sight, as the mushroom’s network of fibres reached out underground, gathering energy and filling up with water. Returning home, it was always a shock, therefore, to witness just how much the booty in the sack shrank once cooked. The reward, on the other hand, was a concentrated essence of pine and soil, autumn and home. As well as the location of the soil, the flavour, texture and colour of a mushroom is also affected by how long it’s left in that soil. Pick a mushroom when it’s young and it will be squeaky clean and relatively bland to taste. These are the little white closed-cup button mushrooms that make their way, very happily, into so many quick stir- fries and omelettes. Leave that same mushroom in the soil for a few more days or weeks, and they become bigger, browner, with a flavour that’s more complex and ‘earthy’. These are the nutty chestnut mushrooms that we love to use in our cooking: grilled and marinated and sitting on top of a bowl of warm for example or bringing depth and body to the veritable mushroom party that is our Here, mushrooms fill every conceivable party role: host and guest, DJ and dancer. Leave them a few days longer and they become even browner, earthier and more robust, as they open to display their inky gills. These are portobello mushrooms, perennially happy to be sat on a baking tray, gill side up, dotted with cheese which will melt under the grill, before being placed inside a brioche bun. Veggie burger sorted, since time immemorial. Squeaky white buttons, nutty brown chestnuts, wide-capped portobellos: these are all common field mushrooms, also known as ‘agaric’ mushrooms. Mushrooms in this group can be identified by looking under their caps: if they have fine gills radiating outwards from the top of their stem, you are in the right field. It’s the gill tissues which generate so much of the aroma of fresh common mushrooms. Those with immature, unopened caps – the baby white buttons, for example – won’t have nearly as much flavour as the umbrella-wide portobellos, which have been allowed to develop and mature more. Agaric mushrooms feed on plant remains and decay (rather than needing a living tree to grow under), so they can, as a result, be widely cultivated. The reason we have so many little white button mushrooms on our supermarket shelves is that they’re really easy to produce. The other category of mushrooms – the ‘boletes’ – do need the soil beneath a tree as a home. These are the porcini (ceps) and the carotene-orange girolles, for example, and the pearly-white oysters. Rather than having a firm stem, separate cap and distinct gills, these mushrooms are more a spongy mass of gills. Boletes form a symbiosis with living trees, in which both partners benefit: the mushrooms gather soil minerals and share them with tree roots, which in turn share the tree’s sugars with the mushrooms. It’s because of this – the fact that these mushrooms need living trees, that intensive production requires a forest and that they’re still largely gathered from the wild – that these sorts of mushrooms are still relatively rare and expensive. It’s because of this, as well, that their taste is so wonderfully transporting, rich and earthy. For our purposes, in FLAVOUR, we’ve kept things relatively simple, using only six different types of mushrooms: three fresh and three dried. Given that the water content of mushrooms is high – about 80–90% – the difference in potential for the fresh vs. dried mushroom to soak up flavours is going to be fairly great. Sure, fresh mushrooms love to be thrown into a pan with some oil and garlic and hard herbs, thirstily taking on the flavours they are paired with, but, first, they’ll have to release much of their liquid before they can do this. Thankfully, this transference is pretty rapid because mushrooms, with their thin outer cuticle, can shed liquid as quickly as they can let it in. Just make sure you are not overcrowding the pan – they need space so that the liquid released can evaporate rather than form a soggy puddle – and you’ll be five minutes away from a simple, tasty meal. Start with dehydrated mushrooms, though, and you’re going to have a veritable sponge on your hands once they’re submerged in a liquid. Dial up the flavour of that liquid with soy sauce, sugar and apple cider vinegar and the world is not only going to be your oyster but also your porcini and your shiitake and your wildest of all flavour-bomb dreams. When rehydrating mushrooms, always keep the liquid they’ve been soaking in, after they’ve been strained. Just as the mushrooms have taken on all the flavours in the stock, so the stock will take on the earthy flavour of the mushrooms. Combining the two in the making of our for example will take your appreciation of ketchup as the definitive ‘umami-rich sauce’ to a whole new level. And there’s another whole approach with dried mushrooms: rather than rehydrating them and taking it from there, they can be blitzed while still dry to form a mushroom powder. It’s when armed with a jar of this, all set to sprinkle through our for example that the case against manufactured MSG can really be made, largely on the grounds of irrelevance. With a pot of dried, blitzed and now powdered shiitake mushrooms, ready to spread their umami depth throughout the porridge-like congee, you won’t need anything more to help boost the flavour. Magical mushroom dust indeed. ALLIUMS Behind so many delicious dishes, there’s often an onion or two at work. Chopped and added to the pan with some oil, the smell of an onion – or its relatives, shallot or leek – being cooked is one of expectation and promise: a meal is under way! If this all sounds a bit much, it wouldn’t be the first time we’ve been accused of onion-shaped hyperbole. Yotam once wrote in the Guardian: ‘Every time we chop an onion and sweat it in oil, it changes from being something that makes us cry to something that makes us smile with joy.’ A reader responded. ‘Every time?’ wrote Brian Smith from Berlin. ‘Don’t be daft!’ We couldn’t help but giggle. Brian clearly had a point – it’s a lot to put on a little white onion – but we do stand by our strength of feeling. The transformation of onions from raw to cooked – from harsh and sulphurous to meltingly soft and sweet – does feel, to us, just a little bit like alchemy. Peek behind the velvet curtains of the magic show, though, and there’s a fair amount of solid science and practical process at play. Unlike other vegetables, the onion family accumulates energy stores not in starch but in chains of fructose sugars, which long, slow cooking breaks down to produce a marked sweetness. The longer and slower the cooking of the onions, either in the oven or in a pan on the stove, the sweeter and the more caramelised these sugars become. This gives rise to glutamic acid. And it’s this acid which gives rise to the big, yummy umami taste we’re so often in search of in FLAVOUR. WORK So much of this work – providing the sweet, caramelised base to many dishes – is what’s going on when onions are behind the scenes, playing a background role. They’re always there in the sofrito or mirepoix base: the diced onions, celery and carrots or peppers which are so often sweated down as the first step to a stew or soup. But this everyday way of using onions isn’t why they get a section all to themselves here. What we find so thrilling are all the instances in which onioniness becomes the ‘thing’ a dish is all about. These are the thick for example or the charred red milder Tropea onions bulking out a summery starter They’re the stealing the side show to anything they’re plated up with or the yellow onions, simply peeled and halved, baked with miso and butter until melting If anything, we’re thinking we need to be laying on a bit more hyperbole, Brian – not less! – to do justice to the onion. The same is true of garlic. A caramelised garlic tart from PLENTY was probably our first dish to be so clearly and unapologetically all about the garlic. More followed, often using a head or two of garlic in a single dish, cooked in different ways. Our freedom to use such lavish quantities totally relies on a breathtaking transformation of flavour which happens in the cooking: from something harsh, almost metallic, to something utterly sweet and mellow. One raw crushed garlic clove might be enough to make a salad dressing sing; three whole garlic heads, cloves separated and peeled, went into that garlic tart, making it the absolute sweetest of all savoury tarts. Again – as with onions – it’s the impact of long, slow cooking on the chains of fructose sugars in the garlic which is being seen here. The harsh notes – those which can linger on the breath when garlic is eaten raw – are the result of sulphurous compounds contained within each clove. The more a garlic clove is crushed and minced, when raw, the more the cell membranes are broken down and the more activated and released these compounds are. This is why one raw garlic clove, finely minced or crushed, goes a long way in a dressing. Gently crush that same clove, though, with the flat side of a big knife, or roast it whole, and no such activation takes place. Anyone in need of further convincing of the benign qualities of huge quantities of garlic needs to try the on which sees 100 grams of butter being able to handle one whole head of roasted garlic, one small raw garlic clove and four black garlic cloves mashed in. Do a taste check, followed by a breath check, and then cast your vote. The black garlic in this butter is something that anyone in search of deep umami flavour will adore. Rather than having to enact the transformation yourself in the kitchen, through the application of heat, black garlic is an ingredient where the work has already been done for you. Starting off as regular white cloves, the effect of time, heat treatment and fermentation is to change them so that they become the liquorice-black, wine-gum-soft-and- squishy cloves that they are. Thinly sliced, the cloves can be added to all sorts of rice dishes – any risotto, for example, or our on or we like to blitz them up in a yoghurt-based sauce. It’s not just black garlic cloves that can be thinly sliced to great effect. Several of the other dishes in this chapter – like the gently cooked or the platter of ‘meaty’ chunks of roasted showcase the way in which a sliver of fried pale golden garlic can bring with it a welcome crunch and pop of un-fiery flavour that adds yet another layer of allium-ness. Being thinly or ‘cleanly’ sliced (as opposed to being minced or mashed when crushed), the process of activating the sulphurous compounds is relatively contained. As such, the garlic can turn crisp and crunchy and golden – thanks to its natural sugars – without being troubled by the acid enzyme. It’s these same sugars which can, at the same time, see slices of garlic pass from being warm and sweet to burnt and bitter in a matter of seconds, though, so keep a close eye on them in the pan and remove them from the oil to a plate lined with kitchen paper just seconds before you think they’re ready. As always, with alliums, it’s a fine balance you need to strike to tease all the sweetness out of those bulbs. It takes some attention, applying judgement and keeping an open eye – all small efforts for the sake of those magical flavours. Of course the opposite of the joy alliums can bring – whether they are chopped or sliced – is the tears they can produce. These tears are the result of volatile compounds within the onion or garlic which are only released when they’re cut. The best way of minimising the release of these compounds is to start with a really sharp knife. This will lead to as ‘clean’ and ‘neat’ a break in the cell wall as possible, thereby reducing the level of volatile compound activation. Other recommendations abound. Some swear by putting onions into the freezer for 10 minutes before chopping, and/or sticking a piece of bread in between your teeth as you work. Whistling, wearing goggles: you choose. Us? We just think of the joy as we chop – the expectation! the promise! – and smile, daftly, on. If mushrooms, onions and garlic are all about body and depth, nuts and seeds can all too easily be seen as sprinkle, surface and light. And with their crunchy texture and nutty aroma, this can, clearly, be the case. As with our other categories of produce, though, nuts and seeds can also be about body and depth. They perform both roles – substance and surface – fantastically well. First, though, some nuts and bolts. Strictly speaking, nuts – alongside grains (wheat, barley, rice, etc.) and legumes (beans and peas) – fall under the umbrella term ‘seeds’. This broad definition, however, doesn’t capture the way we use the words ‘nuts’ and ‘seeds’ as ingredients in the kitchen. For cooks, the definition relies on a couple of factors. One is that, when dry, they’re ready to eat as they are: unlike a dried pulse, for example, you can snack on and crack on with a nut without any soaking or cooking or any other sort of -ing. Toasting them teases out the flavour, sure, but it’s not a necessary part of making them edible or digestible. They taste, well, nutty, and are full of rich and fatty oils. This makes them not only edible but, also, super satisfying and very delicious. It’s useful to spell out what makes a nut a nut because it’s these factors –their ‘being ready to be eaten as they are’, their ‘nuttiness’ and their ‘fattiness’ – which, precisely, makes them so good at bringing body and depth to a dish. Nut pastes, of which tahini is our favourite, are a marvellous manifestation of these three factors. To state what might seem like an obvious point, nut pastes are simply pastes made from blitzing nuts or seeds together. There is nothing else in tahini apart from sesame seeds! All the nutty flavour, rich oil and fatty smoothness is sitting right there in the seeds, waiting to be released once the hulls are blitzed together. Our list of the ways in which tahini can be added to a dish to bring it substance could be very long indeed. From the obvious at one end via to the less obvious at the other, a dribble or drizzle or spoon of tahini can turn unassuming vegetables, such as chickpeas, potatoes and cucumber, into something rich and substantial. As well as being rich and substantial, though, tahini also has the ability to be nutty and light. It’s this that we really love about it. Tahini is happy to be thinned down as much as a dish requires. This allows the sauce to work well with vegetables without their flavour being subsumed. This dilution can happen with all sorts of things – again, depending on what the dish requires. Lemon juice and water work really well, for example, as do tamarind or soy sauce by themselves, or soy sauce mixed with honey. If dilution is one approach to lightening up the nuttiness, mixing the nut paste with another fat altogether is another, very different approach. An Italian pesto is a familiar example, in which pine nuts, olive oil and Parmesan are mixed to a paste (along with basil leaves and garlic). The nuttiness is broken down and, at the same time, complemented by other rich and fatty flavours, giving us a brilliantly complex experience. This same dynamic can be seen in our pumpkin seed and butter paste, for example, into which our are dipped. The butter both moderates the pumpkin seed flavour and, at the same time, enriches it. It also, rather wonderfully, melts nicely into the grooves between the corn kernels to give them a good coating. In both these examples – the pesto and the pumpkin seed butter – we’ve mixed crushed nuts or seeds with dairy. We love to do this – it’s a win-win! – but the dairy factor is not always necessary. Indeed, and thankfully – for vegans who want to experience the milky sensation without eating dairy – the cross-over between nuts and seeds on the one hand and milk and eggs on the other is fairly direct. Take a small handful of seeds and nuts and see this for yourself: take your time chewing them and, as you’ll see, you’ll get a genuinely milky sensation in your mouth. Even if you’re not vegan or don’t think of nut pastes as alternatives to milk or eggs, we have found a natural tendency, in FLAVOUR, to use them in places where, otherwise, a dollop of soured cream or a spoonful of mayonnaise would have made an appearance (see our and our respectively). More often than not, though, vegans use the natural creaminess of nuts consciously to make rich sauces which are normally impossible to achieve without eggs or dairy. Coconuts are famously popular and very effective in giving depth, body and smoothness to vegan soups and stews. We use coconut cream to achieve this in our and there’s also a which has a similar dairy-free creaminess. With a little more effort, a comparable texture and body can be achieved with other nuts too. Soaking or boiling almonds or cashews, for example, in water, then blitzing them smooth, is the basis for the frothy nut milks some like to pour into their cappuccinos. It’s also a great way to get a splendidly creamy and rich sauce in which you can submerge your favourite roasted vegetable or our As well as having an uncanny talent for disguising themselves as milk, nuts are also naturally ‘meaty’, thanks to the high levels of fat and protein they contain. This quality has, however, led to what we think of as an unfortunate consequence: it’s called the Nut Roast. Though we hear that there are versions of nut roasts out there which people swear by and love, we are yet to be convinced. From our experience, they are never as good as a good meatloaf (which is what they are modelled on), nor are they a great showcase for nuts, being soggy and often bland. As a vegetarian or vegan stand-in for the star turkey at the holiday table, we’d far rather have a whole roasted cauliflower, or our with protein coming from side dishes with lentils, chickpeas or soya beans. However, for anyone still craving nuts as the main star at the holiday table, we have our Steamed, fried, then sprinkled with clusters of shiitake mushrooms, nuts and seeds which are flavoured with soy sauce, garlic and maple syrup, this vegan take on a dish from a Chinese dim sum spread is a glorious centrepiece in both looks and complex flavour. Our turnip cake is also an example of a dish which showcases the second role that nuts and seeds can play in a dish. If we’ve looked at all the ways these can bring body and depth, the last-minute smattering of nuts here shows how effective their ‘surface and light’ role can be as well. This is the case as much for an involved dish such as the turnip cake as it is for dishes which are simply and quickly assembled – our for example, or the There are all sorts of ways to achieve this sprinkle and crunch. The simplest is to take one kind of nut, roughly chop it up and go from there. The impact of the almonds in our for example, is a case in point. The fact that you can easily buy already smoked, roasted and salted almonds makes this almost a cheat’s way of disseminating a cluster of little flavour bombs throughout a dish. Starting with plain peeled nuts (sometimes also called ‘raw’ nuts), then adding layers of flavour oneself, is also an easy win. The unsalted blanched peanuts in our for example confidently steal the salad’s show once they’ve been coated in a mix of chilli, golden syrup, salt, lime and olive oil. At this point they’re also, incidentally, the bar snack of all bar snacks. Putting together a combination of seeds and nuts – rather than just starting with the almonds or peanuts, for example – is also a simple option which can yield disproportionate results. Individually, a tablespoon or two of sesame seeds or half a teaspoon of chilli flakes might not seem too exciting. Combine them, though – with a bit of flaked sea salt and half a sheet of blitzed, umami-rich nori seaweed, as we do in our and you suddenly have something that punches well above the little sesame seeds’ weight. A couple of practical notes, to end on. The first is to always taste your seeds and nuts before you use them. The same oils that make nuts so appealing also make them go rancid quite easily. Walnuts, cashews and peanuts are particularly prone to spoilage. Have a nibble and if they taste rancid or floury, get yourself some more. Unfortunately, no amount of toasting or blitzing is able to undo rancid or floury! Second, even if a recipe does not call for nuts or seeds to be toasted, we tend to always give them a little bit of time spread out on a baking tray in a 160°C fan oven. Doing this draws out the oil in the nut or seed and just makes them taste a bit ‘nuttier’ and ‘seedier’. You can toast them in a pan on the stove, instead, if you prefer: just be sure to stir them very frequently and keep a close eye on them. Also, remove them from the pan a little bit before they are done: they keep on browning once off the heat. Don’t get distracted, or you’ll be cursing your half-raw, half-burnt pine nuts before the fun has even started. When we say that particular types of ingredients – mushrooms, onions, nuts and sugar being the four we have identified – have a unique ability to carry a whole dish by themselves and give it its particular edge, sugar is probably the simplest example. How the natural umaminess in mushrooms is key to making a vegetarian lasagne taste meaty is not an intuition we all have. The fact that puddings need sweetness in them, in one form or another, is a natural truth everyone understands. For this reason, it is tempting to look at umami, sitting at the opposite end of the flavour spectrum to sweet, as being interesting, complex and nuanced in a way a dessert could never be, while dismissing sweetness as being one-dimensional. Sweetness equals sugar and sugar equals sweetness: the two get conflated in the mind. Sugar comes in a packet saying either ‘caster’, ‘icing’ or ‘soft dark brown’, and we all know that we shouldn’t eat too much of it. That’s all there is to it, right? But what about all the other ways sugar can be introduced into our cooking and baking – all the different places and produce it can be harnessed from or teamed with for its complexity of flavour? What about all the amazing varieties of honey we can use for our for example? What about the natural sweetness of vanilla and star anise, or the smoky sweetness that happens when sugar is mixed with ancho chilli to make a ? Or the perfumed sweetness of the orange blossom water used for ? The sugar we get from a packet might be one thing, but there are so many more shades of sweetness. Rather than looking at sugar per se, it’s here – in these sugary shades and shadows – that our interest lies. In our constant pursuit of flavour – big, nuanced, dialled-up flavour – it’s here that we want to head. If it’s shades and shadows we’re interested in, one of the best places to look is under a sun-dappled tree. A fruit- growing tree, specifically, which is our first stop at the sweet shop. Using fruit as a means to create all kinds of intricate and complex layers of sweetness is our absolute favourite way of getting sugar into our cooking, particularly when making dessert. All but one of our puddings, in fact, have fruit in them, in one form or another. Strawberries and watermelons bring the sweetness of summer to our and bananas, coconuts, lychees and passionfruit bring the taste of the tropics to our and our Our favourite lemons, limes, oranges and tangerines are so often there, ensuring that sweetness comes also with a citrus tang. In some puddings this is happening in a big, look-at-me way: for example , is served inside a hollowed-out lemon, no less! But citrus fruit can be equally as important when playing a background role, serving mainly to pull back the sweetness from becoming too cloying. Chopping, pulping, juicing and zesting: these are all some of the ways to get fresh, fruity sweetness into a pudding. Dig in and dig down, though, and you see the fruit at work in different ways, often in altogether different ingredients. Take our The fresh apricots are there, of course, halved and pitted and ready to be poached. But then apricot stones have also been used to make the amaretto liqueur, which, in turn, is used in the making of amaretti biscuits, which are, in turn, crushed into the mascarpone. Look further into that mascarpone and, again, you see citrus fruit juice at work. Although lemon juice might not be listed as an ingredient in the recipe for poached apricots, it’s what’s added to whole milk in the first place, to activate the coagulation that needs to take place in the making of mascarpone. Fruit is playing every role here: out front in the foreground, in the middle with the pack, as well as in the background, offstage but still important. The relationship between sweetness and ripeness in fruit is clear: the riper the fruit, the sweeter, softer and juicier it will be. What might be less obvious is the difference between climacteric and non-climacteric fruit. Climacteric fruit, such as bananas, apricots, tomatoes and melons store their sugar in the form of starch. Once picked, this starch is converted back into sweetness. This makes them forgiving and versatile to the home cook, who can either ripen them at home or enhance their sweetness through cooking. Non-climacteric fruit, on the other hand, is not so malleable. This category of fruit includes things like peaches, strawberries, grapes and citrus fruit. Their sweetness will not develop beyond the point at which they’re picked. So, when we state the need for 300 grams of ripe strawberries for our watermelon and strawberry sorbet, then ripe-and-ready they need to be. Making a sorbet with unripe strawberries is never going to capture the essence of summer. Second only to fresh fruit as our favourite means of bringing sugar to the pudding table in an interesting way, is fermented fruit in the form of sweet wine. If we had our way, every dessert would be drenched in some sort of sweet wine or other, with a boozy trifle being the definition of perfection. Sauternes, for example, the sweet French wine, has a wonderfully concentrated, honeyed, crisp, exotic, raisin-like taste. This is due to the ‘noble rot’ – or good fungus – which attacks the three grapes the wine is made from, adding flavour to and intensifying their natural sweetness. The fermentation we trumpeted so passionately in a savoury context in the ageing section is also a massive flavour-enhancing factor here. It’s not just sweet fruit which can be boozy and bottled as wine. Rum, for example, used in our , is made from the fermenting and distilling of sugarcane molasses. Amaretto, the sweet Italian liqueur, is made from brown sugar, vodka (itself made from sweetcorn), almond extract and vanilla extract. The number of different and various sweet notes contained within just these three tipples – grassy, toasted, spiced rum, bitter almond amaretto and honeyed, raisiny Sauternes – points to quite how many very sweet directions in which recipes that use them can be taken. The idea that sweetness is one-dimensional becomes, after a few sips, very hard – quite literally – to sustain. Recipe List"

Toss the chopped mushrooms in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of salt and spread out on a large, 40cm x 35cm parchment-lined, rimmed baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes near the top of the oven, stirring three times throughout, until the mushrooms are golden-brown; they will have reduced in volume significantly. Set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 200°C fan.",
        "Meanwhile, combine the dried mushrooms, chillies and hot stock in a large bowl and set aside to soak for half an hour. Strain the liquid into another bowl, squeezing as much liquid from the mushrooms as possible to get about 340ml: if you have any less, top up with water. Very roughly chop the rehydrated mushrooms (you want some chunks) and finely chop the chillies. Set the stock and mushrooms aside separately.",

Heat 60ml of oil in a large sauté pan or pot on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion mixture and fry for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Pulse the tomatoes in the food processor until finely chopped (or finely chop by hand), then add to the pan along with the tomato paste, 1½ teaspoons of salt and 1¾ teaspoons of freshly cracked black pepper. Cook for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the rehydrated mushrooms and chillies and the roasted mushrooms and cook for 9 minutes, resisting the urge to stir: you want the mushrooms to be slightly crisp and browned on the bottom. Stir in the reserved stock and 800ml of water and, once simmering, reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you get the consistency of a ragù. Stir in 100ml of the cream and simmer for another 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.",

Repeat these layers three more times in that order, and finish with a final layer of sauce and cheese: that’s five layers of sauce and cheese and four layers of pasta.",

Turn the oven to the grill setting and grill for a final 2 minutes, until the edges are brown and crisp.

        "Mix the kohlrabi with the lime juice and ¼ teaspoon of salt in a small serving bowl and set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, mix the mushrooms with the garlic, soy sauce, maple syrup, 75ml of the oil and ¾ teaspoon of salt. Blitz the cumin, cascabel chillies and allspice to a powder in a spice grinder or a pestle and mortar. Put 1½ teaspoons of the spice mix into a small bowl with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and set aside, to serve. Add the rest of the spice mix to the bowl of mushrooms.",
        "Transfer the mushrooms to two large, parchment-lined baking trays, spread out as much as possible, and roast for 20 minutes. Combine all the mushrooms on one tray, mix well and continue to roast for another 8 minutes, until crisp and browned.",
        "While the mushrooms are roasting, make the tortillas. Put the masa harina and a good pinch of salt into a medium bowl and pour in 250ml of boiling water, stirring with a spatula until the dough comes together. Once cool enough to handle, knead into a smooth ball that has the texture of playdough (this should take less than a minute). The dough shouldn’t be wet or come off in your hands, so you may need to add another 10–20g of masa harina depending on the brand you are using, as they can absorb water differently. Divide the dough into 12 pieces weighing about 30g each. With lightly greased hands, roll each piece into a smooth ball. Keep any dough you’re not working with covered with a clean damp cloth.",
        "Get a clean tea towel ready and cut out six squares of greaseproof paper measuring 14cm, which you’ll need to help you press the dough. Place a large, non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Place one piece of dough between two sheets of paper, then, using a heavy-based pan (or a tortilla press, if you have one), press down evenly and firmly on the dough to spread it out into a circle 10–12cm wide. Remove the top sheet of paper and use the bottom sheet to transfer the tortilla to the hot pan. Cook for 90 seconds until nicely browned, then flip and cook for another minute to brown the other side. Transfer the cooked tortilla to the tea towel, fold it over to cover, then repeat with the remaining dough (cook as many tortillas at a time as will fit in the pan).",
        "Warm the mushrooms in a hot oven for a few minutes if they have cooled, then pile on to a large platter and drizzle over the chilli oil you set aside earlier. Serve with the tortillas, lime wedges, crema and pickles (discarding the tea bags from the onions) alongside. This elegant starter was created by Neil Campbell, the charming and creative head chef at ROVI, as a true celebration of the humble onion. When we can, we use Calabrian Tropea onions in the restaurant, which are light red, sweet and wonderfully mild, but other varieties of mild onion are fine too, including regular red onions. The green gazpacho will keep for 3 days in a sealed container in the fridge, as will the whipped feta yoghurt, if you want to get ahead. You’ll make more gazpacho than you need. Whatever’s left, serve in shot glasses to kick- start a summery supper. Serve as part of a mezze spread (see p. 304), or as an elegant starter, individually plated. As a starter 8 Tropea onions, papery outer layers removed, trimmed, halved lengthways, leaving the shoots intact (or 4 red onions, peeled and quartered) 20ml olive oil 2 tsp lemon juice 120g feta, roughly broken 80g Greek-style yoghurt 20g croutons, homemade or shop-bought, roughly chopped ¼ tsp nigella seeds salt and black pepper 2 green peppers, halved lengthways and deseeded (240g) ½ small cucumber, roughly chopped (200g) 1 green chilli, roughly chopped 20g chives 5g tarragon leaves 10g coriander leaves 5g parsley leaves 1½ tbsp apple cider vinegar 1 tbsp olive oil",
        "Preheat the oven to 220°C fan.",
        "First, make the gazpacho. Place the green peppers on a parchment-lined tray, skin side up, and roast for 25–30 minutes, until the skin has blackened a little. Transfer to a small bowl, cover with a plate and leave for 20 minutes, then peel off and discard the skin. Put the peppers into a blender with the remaining ingredients for the gazpacho, 2 tablespoons of water and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Blitz for a few minutes, until you get a smooth, green sauce, then refrigerate until needed. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C fan.",
        "Heat a large, non-stick frying pan on a high heat. Toss the onions with 2 teaspoons of oil, the lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon of salt and some pepper. Place the onions, cut side down, in the hot pan, then turn the heat down to medium-high. For the halved Tropea onions, cook for 5–6 minutes, undisturbed, until the cut side is well charred. If using quartered red onions, cook for 5–6 minutes on each cut side, until well charred. Place the onions in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake until the onions are soft and cooked through, but still holding their shape. This can take anywhere between 30 and 40 minutes, depending on the type of onion.",
        "Put the feta and yoghurt into the small bowl of a food processor and blitz until as smooth as possible (some small lumps will probably remain, which is fine).",
        "Spread the whipped feta on a large platter, creating a dip in the middle with the back of a spoon. Pour about a quarter of the gazpacho into the dip, then arrange the onions haphazardly on top. Finish with the croutons and nigella seeds, drizzle with the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil, and serve."

We serve them – to kick-start a party or as a fine snack – with a dipping sauce made with turmeric, mirin and lime. This punchy combination is perfect with the rich fried onions, but you can easily do without it and serve them with just wedges of lime. A couple of suggestions. Marigolds or kitchen gloves are useful when grating the turmeric, to prevent stubborn yellow marks. Have your dipping sauce prepped, your vegetables battered and your work surfaces ready bef",

Coarsely blitz the toasted pumpkin seeds in a spice grinder (or finely chop them) and leave to cool for 10 minutes.",

Keep refrigerated, if getting ahead, removing it from the fridge 30 minutes before it’s needed, to soften.",

        "Fry the corn in three batches for 6–7 minutes (take care, the oil may spit!), turning them a few times until they have curled slightly and turned golden-brown. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and set aside on a tray lined with kitchen paper while you continue with the rest in the same way. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the honey and 1½ teaspoons of flaked salt.",

You don’t need to make all of them, but having one or two or three in your fridge at any one time is really useful. Five-minutes-made scrambled eggs will never be the same again once you’ve drizzled them with smoked cascabel oil or served them with a bit of charred chilli salsa alongside. A couple of practicalities: if you are making a batch of something for a recipe, it’s often worth doubling or tripling the quantities so that you have some at the ready. Shelf lives and keeping notes vary depending on what you are making, so see each recipe for details. If you are scaling up a recipe, you’ll probably need to increase pan or bowl size and cooking time accordingly. We always give a visual description of what you are looking for, so use this as a guide, if quantities have been increased, rather than sticking religiously to times given. As always, trust your instincts and have the confidence to be your own judge. If you think something is looking, smelling and tasting delicious and ready, then, chances are, it will be.

        "Nori and sesame salt Vegetable-focused meals are flexible by their very nature. There isn’t a natural hierarchy or a clear order in which things need to appear at the table. The notion of a main course and sides, on which so many of us rely, simply doesn’t lend itself so easily to a meal in which meat or fish don’t occupy centre stage. Though we aren’t big fans of any form of fixed meal structure, even when we serve meat or fish, we are aware that the freedom that comes with the plurality of options of a veggie menu can bring with it some confusion. To help a little with choosing how to put together meals from FLAVOUR, we have come up with some suggestions. These are there as ideas only, seeds we plant in your head so you can navigate between dishes you’ve never cooked before. We encourage you to pick and choose from our menus. They are not set in stone. Add if you need more in your meal, take away if you think it’s too much. We would also love you to serve our dishes alongside your old favourites. Cooking a new dish is a challenge, cooking two is double the challenge. Make your life easier by taking single steps, if you need to. In fact, cooking a single dish from the book and serving it with one or two ‘sides’ is something we recommend wholeheartedly. Most of the dishes in FLAVOUR were designed with big flavours in mind. The ‘simple salad’, ‘sautéed greens’ or ‘simple rice’ we mention below are all code for your favourite dishes from the raw veg, cooked veg or starch families. Make them to go with one of our more substantial dishes, and that’s all you’ll need. Lastly, make ahead! Whenever we can we give you an idea about which parts of a recipe can be prepared in advance; often it’s the dish in its entirety. Please take advantage of this. There is nothing better than getting a meal on the table in a matter of minutes and with (what looks like) very little effort. It leaves you stress free and with all the time in the world to enjoy your hard-earned efforts.

The answer is that I don’t. What I did create (with many others) is an environment that I am tremendously proud of: the test kitchen that sits under a railway arch in Camden, north London, and the Ottolenghi restaurants, including NOPI and ROVI. These are the places where new dishes are shaped and it’s the people who work in them that come up with the ideas that find themselves, in print, on people’s kitchen counters. In Camden, alongside Ixta and Tara, Team Test Kitchen is blessed with Noor Murad, who grew up in Bahrain and is the unofficial expert in Middle Eastern feasts, tamarind and everything rice related, amongst countless other talents. I am also immensely grateful to Gitai Fisher, who’s good at everything, and is often the one with the clever idea that helps us crack a ‘troublesome’ dish. Other constant contributors are Calvin Von Niebel, Verena Lochmuller, Paulina Bembel, Neil Campbell, Helen Goh and Esme Howarth. I am grateful to them all. I am also grateful to Claudine Boulstridge for her priceless appraisals. I would like to thank Jonathan Lovekin and Caz Hildebrand, my long-standing creative partners, for being so incredibly good at their jobs, Wei Tang for the props and honesty and Nishant Choksi for the clever illustrations. Thanks also to Sam Carroll and Sytch Farm Studios. Thanks to Felicity Rubinstein for standing by my side, often having to hold my hand, through old challenges and new, and to Lizzy Gray for her intelligence and infinite patience. A massive thank you to Noam Bar for his continual presence behind every single project, to Cornelia Staeubli for her unconditional support and to Sami Tamimi for his friendship. I am also extremely grateful to the team at Ebury: Joel Rickett, Sarah Bennie, Celia Palazzo, Stephenie Naulls, Catherine Wood, Vanessa Forbes and Catherine Ngwong. Across the Atlantic, my deepest thanks to Kim Witherspoon, Aaron Wehner, Lorena Jones, Kate Tyler, Windy Dorresteyn, Sandi Mendelson, Jane Chinn, Kelly Booth, Emma Rudolph, Doug Ogan, Mari Gill, Robert McCullough, Lindsay Paterson, and Carla Kean. Thanks also to Mark Hutchinson and Gemma Bell and her team and to Bob Granleese and Tim Lusher. Finally, but most importantly, thank you to the love of my life, Karl Allen, and to the two monkeys, Max and Flynn. Thanks also to Michael and Ruth Ottolenghi; Tirza, Danny, Shira, Yoav and Adam Florentin; Pete and Greta Allen, Shachar Argov, Garry Chang, Alex Meitlis, Ivo Bisignano, Lulu Banquete, Tamara Meitlis, Keren Margalit, Yoram Ever-Hadani, Itzik Lederfeind, Ilana Lederfeind and Amos, Ariela and David Oppenheim. Thank you to my parents, Nicolas Belfrage and Maria Candida De Melo, for love that knows no bounds, and for the unforgettable adventures through Brazil, Mexico and Italy that shaped the cook that I am today. To my sister Beatriz Belfrage, for wisdom and support I can always turn to. To my cousin Moby Pomerance, for nurturing a love of food in me. Thanks to Claudia Lazarus, my partner in crime in most food-related endeavours outside of Ottolenghi. Thanks to NOPI restaurant, where I met Claudia across a crowded kitchen, and where my Ottolenghi adventure began. Thank you to Alex Intas, for his unwavering love and support, but more importantly for his unwavering willingness to eat. Thanks to Lauren and Felipe Gonzalez, for giving me a copy of Plenty More all those years ago with a message in it to the tune of ‘follow your dreams’. I could never have dreamt of this! To Noor Murad, thank you for being a constant source of light and inspiration. To Jonathan, Lizzy, Celia, Annie, Caz, Wei and Nishant, thank you for helping make this first venture into the world of book-making a joyous one. And, most importantly, thank you to Yotam for the opportunity of a lifetime, and for being a fiercely patient, intelligent and kind teacher.
