Use a potato masher to mash the beans; they don’t need to be completely smooth, just spreadable. Spread the mash over the lamb, then use a spoon to make a few shallow divots. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil and bake for 30 minutes, until nicely colored and bubbly. Rest for 10 minutes before serving."

All the work is done in advance—you can marinate it for up to 2 days in the fridge—and then it’s just into the baking pan and into the oven when you’re ready. The chicken loves the long marination but it can also be cooked straightaway, if you don’t have the time. If you’re going to do this, just season the chicken with the 1 tsp of salt and pepper (which would otherwise go into the marinade), rubbing it thoroughly into the skin before combining it with the rest of the marinade ingredients (no more salt required) and bake according to the recipe.
