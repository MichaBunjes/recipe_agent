        "1. Prepare the leeks by trimming away the dark and light green parts (saving these for stock). You want to be left with just the white part (trimmed to around 6 inches/15cm long). Trim away at the root end, getting rid of any hairy roots, but make sure to still keep some of the root intact. Using a sharp ½ knife, make an incision down the length of the leek (about inch/1cm ¾ deep), stopping inch/2cm short of the root. Turn the leek over and make an incision down the length of the opposite side. Do this again to make eight incisions in total. The leek should open up now to look like a mop.",
        "2. Fill a large, high-sided sauté pan, for which you have a lid, three-quarters full with water, add 1 tablespoon of salt, and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Add the leeks, cover with the lid, and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer the leeks to a colander to drain for 10 minutes, then place them on a clean kitchen towel. Dry them as well as you can. Drain the ’ water and dry out the pan (you ll use this again for frying).",
        "3. Meanwhile, make the green ranch dressing by rst putting the herbs, garlic, buttermilk, olive oil, lime juice, mustard, ⅓ teaspoon of salt, and a good grind of pepper into a food processor and blitzing until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and mix in the sour cream. Refrigerate until needed.",
        "4. Pour the sun ower oil into the sauté pan and heat on medium-high.",
        "5. While the oil is heating, make the batter. Put the chickpea our, ⅓ ¾ cup/40g of the cornstarch, the spices and teaspoon of salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk well to combine. Whisk in the eggs and buttermilk until smooth and there are no lumps. Put the remaining ⅔ cup/75g of cornstarch into a separate large shallow bowl. —",
        "6. Test the oil is hot enough by drizzling in a bit of batter it should sizzle and puff up immediately but not color too quickly. Working with two at a time, dip each leek into the cornstarch and use your ngers to make sure all the strands are well coated. Shake off the excess and then dip it into the fi ’ ’ batter. Again, use your ngers to try to coat all the strands (don t worry if its not perfect), then squeeze down the length of the leek to get rid of any excess batter. You want the leek to be nicely coated but not overly so. Lastly, try to spread the strands as best you can, then carefully transfer to the hot oil. Do the same with the other leek, frying each for 6 minutes, ipping over halfway through, until deeply browned. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels and sprinkle with a little aked salt. Repeat with the remaining two leeks.",
        "7. Divide the leeks among four plates with a lime wedge each. Serve warm, with the green ranch dressing alongside to dip into. Green ranch dressing – Keep refrigerated in a sealed jar for up to 2 days. – Serve as a dip for oven fries (this page) or toss with cooked chicken and stuff into a sandwich."

Dip your hands into the water and wet the outside of one ball of dough, then dip it into the sesame, coating the ball all over. Transfer to a piece of parchment paper and repeat with the remaining dough, so that you have two pieces of dough per sheet of paper.

In fact, weve at times had to “ exercise some restraint: I guess we could say lemon wedges to serve, so ’ ” “ theres the option? says one of the chefs. Someone else nods. Yes, that ” sounds about right. They taste. The lemon wedges are squeezed. Optional, of course, but also essential. ’ Its not that every dish needs an abundance of herbs, or even lots of lemon, ’ to make it sing. Its more about adding that extra oomph where needed, where notes once at become sharp and harmonious. In the culinary game, your trick of the trade will be mastering this balancing act, where something — — rich crispy roasted beans bathed in brown butter will require something fresh: a lemony green onion pesto. The pesto is raw and green, smooth and sharp, and necessary, oh-so-necessary for the dish to come together into one buttery, lemony, pesto-y mouthful (brown-butter butter beans with green onion pesto, this page). ’ Thats not to say that the recipes in this chapter are all brown-butter levels of rich. Some are gentle and warming, as with the brothy black-eyed peas and their zingy grilled onion salsa (this page), and others are sunshine through and through, as with the sunshine salad (this page). What they do all have in “ ” common, though, is that added something which, as it stands, is ’ something happy, something vibrant, and something fresh.

        "1. Preheat the oven to 400 F.",

Alternatively, slice the potatoes by hand. Place the slices in a large mixing bowl and add the herbs, garlic, 3 ½ tablespoons of the oil, 1 teaspoons of salt, and a good grind of pepper and toss gently to combine, being careful not to break apart the potatoes.",
        "3. Lightly grease a large, ovenproof cast-iron frying pan or a round baking dish with a 9-inch/23cm-diameter bottom. Starting from the edges of the pan, arrange the potatoes in a concentric circle, alternating between a few ’ Yukon Gold and a few sweet potatoes (this doesn t have to be perfect). It should look like a swirly ower by the end. Pour the stock evenly over the potatoes. Lightly grease a piece of foil, then cover the pan or dish tightly with the foil, greased side down, and bake for 35 minutes. Remove from the ° oven, then turn the heat up to 450 F and remove the foil. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and bake for 20 minutes, or until nicely browned on top. Set aside to cool slightly, about 15 minutes. ¼",
        "4. Meanwhile, make the chimichurri. Put all the ingredients plus teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper into a small bowl and mix well to combine.",
        "5. When ready to serve, spoon half the chimichurri all over the potatoes and serve the rest in a bowl alongside. Chimichurri – Store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 3 days. – This is the perfect accompaniment to steak or grilled portobello mushrooms. fi A good drizzle of oil (and other nishing touches) It turns out that olive oil vs. butter is the battle of all battles in the Test Kitchen. Noor, so con dent that olive oil would win, did a team tally and found that, actually, the Test Kitchen is split down the middle. Yotam, Gitai, Tara, and Noor are all faithfully team olive oil, and Verena, Clodagh, Chaya, and Jens are all audaciously team butter. Needless to say, this was quite heartbreaking for the olive oil team, who feel slightly betrayed by their “ ’ fi peers: Isn t it an unspoken rule that we nish all our dishes with a good ” drizzle of oil? said the very aghast team olive oil. Alas, the conversation continues, as is the nature of the Test Kitchen, lots and lots of conversations revolving around one shared goal: making good food with good ingredients, with or without olive oil. ’ ’ In an ideal world, you d use a mixture of both, says Verena, and shes not wrong. The two combined make for a wonderful mouth-feel, as is the case for the roasted hake with fenugreek onions (this page), where the onions are cooked until meltingly soft in both fats, alongside fenugreek and all its spicy friends. This creates a rich topping for the sh, which is then baked in a smidge more butter and oil, for a very delightful experience. As the title suggests, this chapter is all about the multitude of ways in which we use oil to avor food (no shade toward team butter, of course). ’ Sometimes its via infusion, as with the smoky chipotle oil (pictured on this page) made to eat alongside the black lime focaccia (this page). Sliced garlic and chipotle chile akes are fried together with the oil, so you get crispy bits and spicy bits throughout, and a striking orange-red oil to dip the bread in. At times the process is much more straightforward, as with the parsley oil spooned over the charred green pepper and bulgur pilaf (this page). The fresh parsley is blitzed with oil and garlic, and used to brighten an otherwise comforting meal. The elephant in the room is of course the saffron water (this page), not an oil at all but rather liquid gold that rightfully ’ deserves a grand seat on anyones shelves. We added it here as, just like a ’ figood drizzle of oil, its very much a nishing touch. In this case, we spoon it onto baked orzo and caramelized fennel, the saffron adding a golden hue to the whole dish. Regardless of where your loyalties lie on the olive oil vs butter debate ’ fi (theres room for both, of course!), we hope you nd inspiration in this chapter, and the numerous extras that come with it. ’",

Use any extra butter to grease the top of the parchment paper as well.",
        "2. Put the slivered pistachios into a food processor and blitz until you have fi fi ’ ne crumbs, roughly the size of couscous or ne bulgur wheat. It won t be as smooth as the almond meal. Put this, the almond meal, and salt into a large bowl and mix well to combine.",
        "3. Put the eggs, yolk, granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons of the vanilla paste into the bowl of a stand mixer tted with the whisk attachment. Beat on – ½ medium-high speed for 3 3 minutes, until well aerated and light in color. ’ This ll help develop the crackly crust you want. Using a spatula, fold in the — ’ lemon zest and pistachio mixture until just incorporated don t overmix it. Pour it into the prepared tart pan and sprinkle evenly with the sliced almonds. Place on a at baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes, until a skewer inserted through the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let the cake cool completely in the pan.",
        "4. Meanwhile, prepare the apricots. Put the elder ower cordial, vanilla pod and seeds (or vanilla bean paste), and the lemon strips into a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat. Cut out a piece of parchment paper roughly the size of the bottom of your pan. As soon as the mixture starts to bubble, turn the heat down to low. Add the apricots to the mixture, cut side up, and place the parchment paper on top, pressing gently to cover the surface. Cook for 3 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and gently turn over each of the apricots. Replace the parchment and cook for 2 minutes more, or until the apricots are soft but not falling apart. Timings will vary depending on the ripeness and size of your apricots, so if they need more time, cook them for a few minutes longer (up to 5 minutes more). Remove from the heat and gently transfer the apricots and everything else to a bowl. Refrigerate the mixture until nice and cold.",
        "5. When ready to serve, make the cream by putting it into the bowl of the fi ’ stand mixer tted with the whisk attachment, along with the confectioners sugar and the remaining 1 teaspoon of vanilla paste (alternatively, do this in – a bowl with a whisk and use your arm muscles!). Beat for 60 90 seconds, or until you have soft peaks. Transfer to a small serving bowl.",
        "6. Use the lining paper to lift the cake from its pan and place on a wooden board, with the paper attached. Pull away at the paper to expose the sides. ’ Don t worry if the cake cracks a little; this just adds to its rustic charm. Dust ’ the surface with the extra confectioners sugar and serve with the cream and poached apricots alongside.

The grains will look a bit like coarse bulgur wheat. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, top with the lid, and refrigerate to infuse overnight.",
        "3. Strain the mixture through a small sieve set over a bowl. Set the sieve and drained rice grains aside (over another bowl) and transfer the infused liquid ½ back to the saucepan. You want 2 cups/600ml of strained liquid (add a ’ splash of cream if you don t have enough). ’",

        "2. To the same stand mixer bowl add the ours, granulated sugar, yeast, ¼ salt, and + ⅛ teaspoon of the crushed cardamom (reserve the remaining cardamom for the glaze). With the dough hook in place, mix the dry ingredients together on medium-low speed for 30 seconds to combine.",
        "3. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together 2 teaspoons of the orange zest, the milk, vanilla paste, and 2 eggs until combined, and add to the stand mixer. Turn the speed up to medium-high and mix for 8 minutes. The dough will be fairly sticky but will start to cling to the dough hook at this point.",
        "4. With the mixer still on medium-high speed, add the butter cubes a quarter at a time until fully incorporated and mix for a total of about 8 minutes. The dough should be smooth and silky now, and will form a ball around the dough hook.",
        "5. Add the chocolate and mix for 30 seconds, just to incorporate. Use your hands to remove the dough from the hook and shape into a ball, tucking in any pieces of chocolate. Cover the surface with plastic wrap and let rise for ½ 1 hours at room temperature, or until almost doubled in size.",
        "6. Fold the dough over on itself to de ate, cover again, and refrigerate for 2 ’ hours or overnight. (This ll make it easier to shape later.)",
        "7. Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch/23cm square baking pan and ¼ line with parchment paper, leaving a 1 -inch/3cm overhang on two ’ opposite sides (this ll help you lift the buns out later).",
        "8. When ready to shape the buns, transfer the dough to a lightly oured work surface and divide into 16 pieces, roughly 2 oz/55g in size. Shape each piece into a smooth ball and transfer to the prepared baking pan, set close together in rows of four. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise at room ½ temperature for 1 hours or until doubled in size (if shaping an overnight dough, this could take up to 2 hours). °",
        "9. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Beat the remaining 1 egg and use it to brush the top of the buns, then bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan, turn the heat ° down to 350 F, and bake for 15 minutes more. Let cool for a few minutes, then use the parchment overhang to help you lift the buns out of the pan and onto a wire rack. Let cool for about 30 minutes. ’",
        "0. Meanwhile, in a small bowl whisk together the confectioners sugar, orange juice, 1 teaspoon of orange zest, and the remaining crushed cardamom until smooth. Brush this over the still-warm buns and, nally, ¼ sprinkle with the extra pistachios and the remaining teaspoon of orange zest. These are best eaten on the day they are made.

Acknowledgments The premise of this book came quite naturally, after a discussion between Yotam and Noor about the way they eat, accessorising their everyday meals with the shattah in the fridge, or the dukkah in the cupboard. In fact, this is common ground for everyone at the Test Kitchen where, at the end of a work day, any leftovers will be taken home by a willing volunteer to be repurposed in some other way. This book is another of the many stories and skills the OTK wants to share with you, but, as is always the case, no story is complete without some help from our friends. A huge thank-you to Team Ebury, especially Lizzy Gray and Emily Brickell, who took over the reins and kept us speedily on track. We also extend our thanks to Joel Rickett, Sarah Bennie, Stephenie Reynolds, Lara McLeod, Catherine Ngwong, Catherine Wood, Anjali Nathani, Aslan Byrne, and Annie Lee. Across the pond we thank the team at Clarkson Potter: Aaron ’ Wehner, Jennifer Sit, Lydia O Brien, Windy Dorresteyn, Kate Tyler, Maria Zizka, Ian Dingman, Kim Tyner, Mark McCauslin, Chris Tanigawa, and Jana Branson. For the design, a big thank-you to Caz Hildebrand and Julie Martin, who carried the whimsical spirit of OTK from book 1 through to book",
        "2. We also send big Wei-sized hugs to Wei Tang, for always delivering on the coolest props and sourcing all the existing jars within a 1,000-mile radius. For the photography, we are beyond delighted to have welcomed back (with open arms!) Elena Heatherwick and her partner-in-(comedic)-crime, Lesley Lau. In typical Elena fashion, both our photos and our shoot days were made that much brighter. — Shout out to Gemma Bell and Co. for all the support social and much more! “ ” And lots of love to Tom Walker for capturing the unique OTK personalities via video. Many thanks to Felicity Rubinstein, Kim Witherspoon, and Mark Hutchinson for their continuous support throughout the OTK journey. As always, a big thank-you to Cornelia Staeubli and Noam Bar for their continual presence and support of the Test Kitchen team. Noor's acknowledgments ’ It wasn t so long ago that I sat down to write these very acknowledgements for Shelf Love, a book that came at me when I least expected it. Extra Good Things came together very soon after, with a 180° shift in focus: from ’ fi clearing ones pantry to lling it, from scarcity to abundance, from stripped back to a lot more embellished. Yotam often says that all his books are like ’ his children, and I didn t get it until recently, when I did. As Shelf Love was wholeheartedly welcomed and embraced into the world (thanks, world!), — Extra Good Things was only just brewing a sibling with its own unique identity. And somewhere in this whirlwind of books and recipes, of photoshoots and write-ups and more condiment jars than you can possibly — fathom, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy in community, in creativity, in the support system that are friends, colleagues, family, and beyond. To more people than I can list, I owe a whole load of shukrans. — To my two halves, Salah and Vanessa Murad who technically make me half — machboos and half scone thank you for your unconditional love and support. ’ ’ To my work fam: Gitai, who hasn t yet divorced me as work-wife (heres hoping you never will), thank you for being equal parts salty and sweet when I need it, and for pushing me when I need it even more. You bring the “ ” fi Extra, ya ekhti. To Verena, I appreciate you letting me eat the lling out of your pies and learning to love me anyway. You remain an incredible chef and forever friend. To Chaya, for adding plenty of spice and cheer to my — ’ days with your colorful array of dresses and rainbow leggings don t ever change! To Tara, for your continuous support for all things OTK. To “ ” — ’ Claudine, for being the best seal of approval from Wales Im not sure how ’ wed function without you, C! To Clodagh, Jens, and Jake, for sliding so easily into the OTK family and for being such a pleasure to work with.
