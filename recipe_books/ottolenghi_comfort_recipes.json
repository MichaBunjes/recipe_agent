Mulligatawny Serves 6 Comfort food is often the food we cook when we are away from home. This happens on all sorts of scales (individual, communal) and in every direction (immigration, emigration). Mulligatawny has its origins in Brits abroad, namely the British Raj. The colonial Brits, missing the soup they normally had at the start of every meal, were keen to have it re-created. The Indian cooks, unfamiliar with the tradition of a standalone soup as a starter, created a thin, spicy “ ” Madrasi broth known as molo tunny or pepper water. Bulked out with meat and vegetables to suit the extravagant tastes of the British, mulligatawny was born. Pictured on this page.

Zucchini and fennel lasagne Serves 8 Thanks to Verena, we have the veggie lasagne everyone has been waiting for. The veggies get a relatively long time roasting before the dish is assembled, which makes for a hugely rich and flconcentrated avor. The white sauce, on the other hand, takes ’ much less time than it normally does. It s a no-cook version, taking seconds to blitz up. Pictured on this page. 6–7 large zucchini, thinly sliced (3⅓ lb/1.5kg) 3 large fennel bulbs, thinly sliced (2 lb 2 oz/1kg) 2 bunches of green onions, finely sliced (2¼ cups/175g) 1 cup plus 2 tbsp/265ml olive oil 4 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste ⅓ cup/45g capers, roughly chopped 1½ tsp fennel seeds, toasted and roughly crushed 1¾ oz/50g dill, roughly chopped 1 oz/30g parsley, roughly chopped 1 large lemon: finely grate the zest to get 1 tsp, then juice to get 3 tbsp ⅔ cup/160ml vegetable stock (or water) ½ tsp honey 3 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted 10½ oz/300g fresh lasagne sheets salt and black pepper Ricotta cream 1 cup/250g ricotta 6 oz/175g pecorino romano, finely grated (1⅔ cups) 4½ oz/125g buffalo mozzarella, roughly chopped ⅓ cup/80ml heavy cream Preheat the oven to 500°F. Combine the zucchini, fennel, and green onions in a large bowl, along with ⅔ cup/160ml of the olive oil, 2¼ teaspoons of salt, and a good grind of pepper. Mix well, then spread out on two parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Roast for 40 minutes, rotating the sheets and giving everything a good stir halfway through.",
        "Remove the sheets from the oven and combine the vegetables on one sheet.",
        "Add the garlic, capers, fennel seeds, half of the dill, two- thirds of the parsley, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and stir to combine. Return the sheet to the oven for 10 minutes. Turn the oven down to 400°F, add the stock to the vegetables, and cook for 5 minutes. Carefully transfer to a bowl and set aside. Next, make the pesto.",
        "Put the remaining dill, parsley, lemon juice, and the lemon zest into the small bowl of a food processor.",
        "Add 7 tbsp/100ml of the olive oil, the honey, toasted pumpkin seeds, and ¼ teaspoon of salt, and blitz to combine.",
        "Transfer to a small bowl and set aside. For the ricotta cream, put the ricotta, 4½ oz/125g (1¼ cups) of the pecorino, and all the mozzarella into the large bowl of the food processor.",
        "Add the heavy cream and ⅛ teaspoon of salt and blitz until thoroughly combined. Spoon a small portion of the vegetables into the bottom of an 8 x 12-inch/20 x 30cm baking dish, just enough to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Arrange a layer of pasta sheets over the top (cut them fito t your dish) and spoon on a third of the remaining vegetables, followed by 6 tablespoons of the ricotta cream (just roughly dotted fiaround is ne) and 1½ tablespoons of the pesto. Sprinkle with about ½ tablespoon of the pecorino and repeat the layering process twice more, until you are left with a bare layer of pasta on top. Spread the remaining ricotta cream over the top and sprinkle with the rest of the pecorino. Drizzle with the remaining 1 – tablespoon of olive oil and bake for 40 45 minutes, rotating the – dish halfway through, until nicely browned. Let rest for 20 30 minutes before serving with the remaining pesto alongside. Sausage ragù lasagne for one Serves 1, with leftovers ’ The image we tend to have of lasagne is that it s always served in a great big dish, brought to a heaving table. We wanted to reclaim it for the solo diner, though, which is what our clever test kitchen “ colleague Chaya Pugh did for a Guardian column, themed eating ” for one. It has all the delights of pasta and lasagne without all the ’ prep time (or crowds!). And don t worry about missing out on a — corner piece (with all their crispy edges) the folded lasagne sheets are great for creating these crispy bits.",
        "To make this fivegetarian, swap the sausage for rm tofu or mushrooms. Pictured on this page. 1 tbsp olive oil 4 small sausages, casings removed and discarded (9 oz/250g) 1 small carrot, finely chopped (⅓ cup/50g) 1–2 shallots, finely chopped (½ cup/70g) ½ tsp thyme leaves ⅓ oz/10g oregano leaves 3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste 1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed ½ x 14-oz/400g can of whole, peeled tomatoes, crushed ¾ cup plus 2 tbsp/200ml boiling water 3 fresh (or dried) lasagne sheets (4½ oz/130g) 4½ oz/125g buffalo mozzarella salt and black pepper Put the oil into a small ovenproof sauté pan and place on medium- high heat.",
        "Once hot, add the sausage meat, carrot, shallots, thyme, and three-quarters of the oregano. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, using the spoon to break up the sausage meat.",
        "Add the garlic and fennel seeds and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, until bubbling.",
        "Add the boiling water, a good grind of pepper, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Decrease the heat to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and looks glossy.",
        "Preheat the oven broiler to its highest setting. Fill a medium saucepan with 1 quart/liter of water, add 1 tablespoon of salt, and place on medium-high heat.",
        "Once – simmering, add the lasagne sheets and cook for 2 minutes (or 6 8 minutes, if using dried). Drain and set aside. Tear or cut the lasagne sheets in half and stir into the ragù. Simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has softened and is nicely coated in the sauce.",
        "Using a spoon, lift and arrange the sheets so they sit in folds, like handkerchiefs nestling in the sauce. Roughly tear the mozzarella and place it in between the layers and on top of the lasagne.",
        "Place under the broiler for about 6 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and some of the lasagne sheets have crispy edges.",
        "Remove from the oven and serve, with the remaining oregano on top."
